              <p>Under Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers’ two-year proposed budget, Dunn County would receive $14 million in investments for 2019-21, with a large portion of funding supporting Medicaid, hospitals, doctors and health care, two Democrat senators said Tuesday in Menomonie.
              </p>
              <p>About 20 people attended a Tuesday listening session hosted by Sen. Patty Schachtner, D-Somerset, and Sen. Jeff Smith, D-Brunswick, at the Shirley Doane Senior Center in Menomonie.
              </p>
              <p>Schachtner and Smith heard questions about the future of Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers’ proposed two-year state budget — and questions about the future of Dunn County’s nursing homes, mental health care and broadband internet.
              </p>
              <p>Neil Koch of Menomonie, a retired hydrologist, asked that the state devote $10,000 for a pilot study in Dunn County to determine nitrate levels in household wells that sit near septic systems.
              </p>
              <p>“If it is determined wells in densely populated areas around Menomonie have high nitrate, then good drinking water needs to be provided by the city of Menomonie or rural water assistance needs to be established,” Koch said. “This is a major statewide health problem.”
              </p>
              <p>Terry Nichols of the town of Colfax criticized the “tidal wave of referenda” that have been passed to fund Wisconsin school districts, saying the referendum funding mechanism puts unfair burden on retired seniors.
              </p>
              <p>“It’s the elephant in the room,” Nichols said.
              </p>
              <p>Margy Hagaman urged the state to fund a dementia specialist position for Dunn County and praised the budget’s Medicaid expansion.
              </p>
              <p>“In our immediate area, we’ve had four (nursing homes) that have closed ... our tax dollars are being paid federally, and it’s not coming back to the state. We’ve got to have that money back here in the state,” Hagaman said.
              </p>
              <p>Under Evers’ proposed budget, middle class residents would see a 10 percent income tax cut; the state would accept an expansion of federal Medicaid funding; the gas tax would be raised by eight cents per gallon; property taxes would increase about 1.7 percent on the median-valued home; funding for K-12 schools would increase by 10 percent; and medical marijuana would be legalized.
              </p>
              <p>For Schachtner, funds to fight addiction and support mental health are vital: “The people have clearly told us, it’s an issue.”
              </p>
              <p>Smith called the acceptance of federal Medicaid dollars “the most important” part of Evers’ proposed budget.
              </p>
              <p>The budget would expand Medicaid to about 595 Dunn County residents, according to Department of Health Services data released Tuesday.
              </p>
              <p>Dunn County is one of a majority of Wisconsin counties that don’t have enough dentists for their populations, Smith said: “We’re next to the bottom for reimbursement for dental care in Medicaid.”
              </p>
              <p>Of the $14 million that would be invested in Dunn County, according to Evers’ administration, $646,000 would enhance Medicaid services, including community health and postpartum services for new mothers; $610,000 would increase funding for providers in long-term services such as nursing homes; and $492,000 and $358,000 would increase physician funding and hospital funding, respectively.
              </p>
              <p>In the Republican-controlled Legislature, Evers is seeing roadblocks. Wisconsin Republicans have criticized Evers’ proposals for expanding Medicaid, legalizing medical marijuana and freezing enrollment at private voucher schools.
              </p>
              <p>Rep. Rob Stafsholt, R-New Richmond, who represents portions of western Dunn County, said in February that the budget “seems to be filled with empty promises, unrealistic spending initiatives and tax increases.”
              </p>
              <p>Rep. Warren Petryk, R-Eleva, said in February he was “cautious” about Evers’ proposals: “With record low unemployment numbers and more people working than ever before in our history, we cannot afford to go backwards.”
              </p>
              <p>Smith said he’s expecting a contentious budget fight.
              </p>
              <p>“We have a shared government for the first time in a long time,” Smith said. “We’re going to have a lot of learning curve for a lot of people.”
              </p>
              <p>Schachtner represents the 10th Senate District, which covers parts of Dunn, Burnett, Pierce, Polk and St. Croix counties. Smith represents the 31st Senate District, which covers parts of Dunn, Eau Claire, Trempealeau, Jackson, Monroe, Buffalo, Pierce, Pepin and Clark counties.
